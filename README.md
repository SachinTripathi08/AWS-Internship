# ☁️ AWS Cloud Internship Project 2025

Welcome to my AWS Cloud Training & Internship Repository!  
This repository documents my hands-on journey through Amazon Web Services using **Free Tier** tools and services. Throughout the internship, I worked on real-world, modular cloud solutions with detailed configurations, screenshots, and implementation steps.

## 🚀 What's Included?

Here you’ll find five core modules I explored during the internship, each designed to strengthen my practical understanding of cloud computing fundamentals.

### 🖥️ 1. Amazon EC2 – Elastic Compute Cloud  
**Deploy, Manage & Scale Virtual Servers in the Cloud**

Amazon EC2 lets you spin up virtual machines and manage scalable compute resources in the cloud. In this project:

- Launched both **Linux** and **Windows** virtual servers
- Installed and hosted websites using **Apache (Linux)** and **IIS (Windows)**
- Created and reused **Custom AMIs** for faster provisioning
- Attached **EBS volumes** for additional persistent storage
- Used **Snapshots** for backup and recovery
- Set up **Auto Scaling Groups** and **Load Balancers** for fault tolerance and high availability

### 🗃️ 2. Amazon S3 – Simple Storage Service  
**Store, Secure & Share Data at Scale**

Amazon S3 offers highly available and scalable object storage. My work on S3 included:

- Creating and configuring multiple **S3 Buckets**
- Managing **public/private** access using bucket policies and IAM
- Enabling **Versioning** to track changes across files
- Using **Presigned URLs** for time-limited secure file access
- Exploring various **storage classes** (Standard, IA, Glacier) to optimize cost
- Hosting a **Static Website** directly from an S3 bucket

### 📢 3. Amazon SNS – Simple Notification Service  
**Send Instant Notifications via Email & SMS**

Amazon SNS is used for real-time alerting and communication. In this project, I:

- Created **SNS Topics** and set up **Email/SMS Subscriptions**
- Verified subscription endpoints securely
- Sent messages using both the **AWS Console** and **CLI**
- Understood the **Pub/Sub architecture** in action
- Managed and cleaned up unused topics to control usage costs

### 📬 4. Amazon SQS – Simple Queue Service  
**Queue-Based Messaging for Decoupled Applications**

Amazon SQS provides durable message queues for asynchronous processing. Here’s what I did:

- Set up **Standard Queues** to send/receive messages
- Connected **SNS Topics** to SQS for real-time data flow
- Simulated a **Pub/Sub pattern** using SNS + SQS
- Triggered **Lambda Functions** using SQS events
- Practiced queue management, including purging and deletion

### 🛡️ 5. AWS IAM – Identity and Access Management  
**Control Access and Protect AWS Resources**

IAM enables secure access control for AWS resources. My exploration of IAM involved:

- Creating custom **Users**, **Groups**, and **Roles**
- Applying both **Managed** and **Custom Policies**
- Testing access permissions for EC2, SNS, and other services
- Following the **Principle of Least Privilege** for security
- Cleaning up unused users and policies to maintain a secure environment
